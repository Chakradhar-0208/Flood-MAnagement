# Flood Management System
## Introduction :
This project aims to develop a Flood Management System using Python. The system provides tools and functionalities to assist in managing flood-related tasks, such as monitoring water levels, predicting flood occurrences, coordinating rescue operations, and assessing flood risks.

## Features :
-  Level Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of water levels in rivers, streams, and other water bodies to track changes and assess flood risks.

- Flood Prediction: Utilizes historical data and predictive models to forecast potential flood occurrences, allowing for early warning and preparation.

- Rescue Operation Coordination: Provides tools for coordinating rescue operations, including tracking the locations of rescue teams and individuals in distress.

- Risk Assessment: Assess the risk of flooding in specific areas based on various factors such as terrain, weather patterns, and infrastructure.

## Usage :
This Flood Management System is designed to be modular and customizable based on specific needs and requirements. Detailed usage instructions for each module will be provided in the respective directories.
